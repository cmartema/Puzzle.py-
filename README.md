# Puzzle.py - Assignment README

## File Name
Please make sure to name your Python file as follows:
- Filename: `puzzle.py`
Failure to use this exact filename will result in non-grading of your submission.

## Function Skeletons
In `puzzle.py`, you will find skeleton functions provided for you. You are expected to write your code only within the designated functions and blocks as specified. **Do not modify the function signatures or any code that is not specified to be modifiable.** Any unexpected modifications that cause the autograder to malfunction will result in a score of zero.

You are allowed to modify the `main` function as needed to make the program run according to the assignment requirements.

## Python Version
Only Python 3.x versions will be graded. Please ensure that your code is compatible with Python 3.

## Library Usage
You are allowed to import the Numpy library if you wish, but please note that the homework can be completed without it. No other libraries are allowed to be imported.

## Running Your Code
To receive points, ensure that your code runs correctly. We recommend using development environments like Spyder, PyCharm, or Google Colab, which allow you to download `.py` files. Be cautious when writing your code in certain platforms (e.g., Codio) and copying it into a text file, as it may introduce spurious characters into your code, causing it not to compile. Always verify that your `.py` file compiles and runs without errors.

## Submission and Feedback
After submitting your code on Gradescope, you will receive feedback within 5 minutes regarding your code's filename, output format, and execution time. Please address any issues mentioned in the feedback and resubmit your assignment before the deadline.

Thank you for following these guidelines, and good luck with your assignment!
